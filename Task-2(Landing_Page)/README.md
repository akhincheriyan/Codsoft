## ABOUT

This milestone involved designing and developing a One Direction music band landing page using HTML and CSS. The project allowed me to:

- Create a visually appealing and fan-focused design.

- Showcase the band's legacy, music, and upcoming events.

- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes.

- Use creative layout techniques to capture the band's unique style and essence!
