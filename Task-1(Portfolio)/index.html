        <div class="container about-container">
            <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering and seeking an entry-level role in the tech industry. During my academic journey, I developed a strong passion for modern technologies and an eagerness to explore and understand them in depth. One of the courses that captivated me the most was web design, where I had the opportunity to create a website from scratch. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for coding and deepened my interest in building larger, more complex web applications in the future.When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring graphic design, and playing video games. These hobbies help me stay creative and relaxed while inspiring new ideas for my projects.My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer and contribute to innovative projects that advance technology and improve lives. I am eager to work in a dynamic organization where I can continue to learn, grow, and make a difference</p>

                        Web design is the art of crafting visually appealing and user-friendly websites, blending
                        elements like typography, color theory, and layout to create memorable online experiences. HTML,
                        CSS, and JavaScript are the cornerstone languages that enable us to build interactive and
                        responsive websites, making them not only look great but also function seamlessly on various
                        devices interface.Web Design is the process of creating, making, and developing websites. It includes many different features such as webpage layout, webpage content, and also graphic designs. In general web design and web development work together, but the term web design is an actual category of web development. The main way of creating websites is building it from scratch using HTML language; which stands for Hypertext markup language. Web designers build websites using HTML tags that define the content of each page. The layout of the webpage and the appearance of all the elements will be built by using CSS; which stands for Cascading Style sheets. Therefore, all of the websites are being of combination of HTML and CSS files to define of how the page going to appear to the client or user. Many web designers prefer to build a web page starting from scratch by typing HTML and CSS codes, and others they prefer using a software for building and designing these webpages. Some of these soft wares to build and design websites are Dream Weaver which is mostly being used on MAC operating system or WordPress and Joomla which makes it easier for the web designer to design the webpage using the templates that these software already have listed, when the designer choose which template to use the software will automatically build the HTML and CSS files to create that template which also saves time and energy of writing those codes.
